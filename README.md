# Self-Adjusting Package Delivery System

## Overview
An optimized package delivery system using a **Greedy Algorithm** for route optimization and a **Hash Table** for efficient package management. The system dynamically assigns and delivers packages while minimizing travel distance and maximizing efficiency.

## Features
- **Greedy Algorithm** for fast, proximity-based delivery decisions
- **Hash Table** for efficient package lookup and management
- **Scalable Design** to accommodate larger datasets
- **Optimized Time Complexity** of O(TP^2) for package assignment
- **Built with Python 3.11** for performance and maintainability

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/package-delivery-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd package-delivery-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Start the program and follow the interactive command-line prompts.
- Generate a delivery report by selecting option "1" and entering a time (e.g., "2:00 PM").

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11**
- **PyCharm IDE**
- **Hash Table** for package management
- **Greedy Algorithm** for route optimization
